## My process
I'm doing some navbars to have understand CSS better and also because this is a common feature in websites,


### What I learned
Today I learned about the style-type tag, these dots are a pain.
```css
.nav-links {
  list-style: none;
}
```

I also liked the CSS chaining and the hover property
```css 
.nav-links li a:hover {
  color: #0088a9;
}
```
